## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
-Through linear regression was able to idenitfy that vehicle length and the ground_clearance provided non random amounts of variance. The intercept was also statistically significant which indicates that there are possibly other factors that have a  impact on the MPG.
-The p-value was less than zero (5.35e-11), meaning the slope is not equal to zero
-The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 71% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model. The main indicator of whether the linear model predicts the mpg of the MechaCar is the r-squared value. This means that the model would be considered effective with that under consideration.

Under the total summary, the PSI is under 100 and meets the design speicifications. Looking at each lot indicudually, not all lots fit the speicifcations. Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet it, but lot 3 is signicatanly over the 100 PSI at 170.28
