## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
-Through linear regression was able to idenitfy that vehicle length and the ground_clearance provided non random amounts of variance. The intercept was also statistically significant which indicates that there are possibly other factors that have a  impact on the MPG.
-The p-value was less than zero (5.35e-11), meaning the slope is not equal to zero
-The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 71% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model. The main indicator of whether the linear model predicts the mpg of the MechaCar is the r-squared value. This means that the model would be considered effective with that under consideration.
